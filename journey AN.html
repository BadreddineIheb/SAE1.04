                <h2>Where do I come from?</h2>
                <p>I am a Tunisian born on 11/12/2005 in Kairouan which was my hometown for 17 years and which I loved and which I still love today but to realize my dream, I had to leave her.</p>  
                <h2>parcours Ã©ducatif:</h2>
                <p>I started my studies at primary school in my hometown for 6 years, then passed the competition among more than 50,000 students, being one of 175 who were accepted into the high school. After 3 years, I changed to another private high school and then continued the French baccalaureate in final year, with the specialties NSI (Digital and Computer Sciences), mathematics and physics, which I passed successfully. After finishing the baccalaureate and being accepted at the university of my choice, the IUT of Colmar, I had to leave my country to pursue my dream of success. Now I am a student at IUT in Colmar, France, and I am striving to obtain my BUT degree in the field of networks and telecommunications. I am happy and ready to give my best to succeed.</p>   
                <h2>Quels sont mes plans pour l'avenir ?</h2>
                <p> For my future projects, first of all, I will obtain my GOAL in Networks and Telecommunications. Then, I will try to continue my studies in a country other than France, perhaps in Canada or Germany. I will pursue an engineering degree and do my best to succeed. My dream is to become a cybersecurity engineer in the future. It's a big dream and difficult to achieve, but with hard work I can make it happen.</p>            </div>
