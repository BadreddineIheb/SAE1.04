                <h2>Basketball:</h2>
            
                <p>So for my sporting experience, I practiced a lot of different sports that focus on my physical and mental qualities. initially I did 1 year of football academy in my hometown when I was young then I did 2 years of basketball around the age of 12 then after I started sports that make the muscles work muscles like weight training and a little self defense and until these days I practice in the weight room and try my best to stay healthy.But basketball is kind of the sport which made me happy and I still play it when I can. Basketball is a team sport that pits 2 teams of 5 players against each other on a court. The objective? Pass a ball through a hoop located 3.05 meters above the ground to score baskets. The points awarded vary depending on the distance of the shot. There are 3 points for a long shot of the ball in the basket and 2 points for a close shot of the ball in the basket. A basketball team is generally made up of players , a coach and his assistants, a captain who leads on the field, substitutes ready to come on, referees who ensure the smooth running of the match, and passionate supporters. The technical staff, including tactics and fitness specialists, work collaboratively to maximize the team's performance. Unity and coordination between all of these elements are essential to achieving success on the court. In basketball, the different positions include the center, often specialized in protecting the basket and rebounding, and the power forward, versatile as well. in attack and defense. These players occupy key positions near the basket, bringing a diversity of skills crucial to the team's strategic balance on the court. And I admire professional players like LeBron James and Stephan Curry in this sport. practiced a lot throughout my life and I learned many qualities from it. (Teamwork, respect for rules, self-confidence, personal development, hard work) below you will find images of the two greatest players of the game of basketball.</p>                <div class="image-box-MCIP">

                <h2>Video games:</h2>              
                <p>For my second point of interest, I enjoy playing video games much more than anything that video games have helped me develop in life, firstly by giving me attributes like focus on things, teamwork and good strategy, project planning and many other things.I learned patience and hard work by playing different games and developed my ability to solve different problems by playing puzzle games and much more. The games I play are very varied, from first person shooters like Warzone, Fortnite, to scary games like Phasmophobia, or puzzle games. But I mostly play Warzone which is a first person shooter where there are a lot of different modes, but the one I particularly play is Battel Royal where 100 people jump out of a plane into a big map where they loot weapons and get the materials they need to fight and get to the top and win the match by being the last survivor.</p>                <div class="image-box-MCIP">
